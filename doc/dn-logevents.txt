INTRODUCTION                                              *dn-logevents-intro*

A plugin that logs events to file.

The log file location is set by default (in most cases), and can be set with a
global variable or plugin command. See |dn-logevents-logfile| for further
details.

Not all events are logged. See |dn-logevents-events| for further details.

Logging is off by default. It is toggled on and off with the command
|:LogEvents|. Current logging status can be displayed with the command
|:EventLoggingStatus|.

User messages can be written to the log file (see command |:AnnotateEventLog|)
and the log file deleted (see command |:DeleteEventLog|).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *dn-logevents-config*

                                                             *g:dn_events_log*
The path to the log file. Must be set before the dn-logevents plugin is
initialised, and is intended to be set in |vimrc|. See |dn-logevents-logfile|
for further details on setting the log file path.

==============================================================================
LOG FILE                                                *dn-logevents-logfile*

The default log file name is "vim-events-log" in the user's home directory.
The plugin will look for the home directory. On Windows systems it will look
for the variable $USERPROFILE. On all other systems it will look for the
variable $HOME. If the variable is found, the default log file is set to
"$USERPROFILE/vim-events-log" or "$HOME/vim-events-log".

If the variable |g:dn_events_log| is set at the time of plugin initialisation,
the log file path is set to the value of the variable.

At any time the log file path can be changed using the |:EventLogFile|.

The plugin does not check whether the logfile path is valid. If the logfile
path is invalid it will result in system errors when the plugin attempts to
write to the log file.

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                   *dn-logevents-events*

The following events are logged:

BufAdd, BufCreate, BufDelete, BufEnter, BufFilePost, BufFilePre, BufHidden,
BufLeave, BufNew, BufNewFile, BufRead, BufReadPost, BufReadPre, BufUnload,
BufWinEnter, BufWinLeave, BufWipeout, BufWrite, BufWritePost, BufWritePre,
CmdUndefined, CmdwinEnter, CmdwinLeave, ColorScheme, CompleteDone, CursorHold,
CursorHoldI, CursorMoved, CursorMovedI, EncodingChanged, FileAppendPost,
FileAppendPre, FileChangedRO, FileChangedShell, FileChangedShellPost,
FileReadPost, FileReadPre, FileType, FileWritePost, FileWritePre,
FilterReadPost, FilterReadPre, FilterWritePost, FilterWritePre, FocusGained,
FocusLost, GUIEnter, GUIFailed, InsertChange, InsertCharPre, InsertEnter,
InsertLeave, MenuPopup, QuickFixCmdPost, QuickFixCmdPre, QuitPre, RemoteReply,
SessionLoadPost, ShellCmdPost, ShellFilterPost, SourcePre, SpellFileMissing,
StdinReadPost, StdinReadPre, SwapExists, Syntax, TabEnter, TabLeave,
TermChanged, TermResponse, TextChanged, TextChangedI, User, VimEnter,
VimLeave, VimLeavePre, VimResized, WinEnter, and WinLeave.

The following events are intentionally not logged because, according to the
original project, they resulted in "side effects":

BufReadCmd, BufWriteCmd, FileAppendCmd, FileReadCmd, FileWriteCmd,
FuncUndefined, and SourceCmd.

If an event does not appear in either list above, it has been missed!

COMMANDS                                               *dn-logevents-commands*

:LogEvents                                                        *:LogEvents*
  Toggle logging of events.

:EventLoggingStatus                                      *:EventLoggingStatus*
  Get status of event logging, i.e., whether it is enabled or not, and display
  the log file path.

:EventLogFile {path}                                           *:EventLogFile*
  Log future events and notes to file {path}.

  If {path} is the name of the current log file, the command will have no
  effect. If the plugin is currently logging to a different file, that file is
  closed and the new log file opened.

  If the {path} is invalid or unwritable an error will occur when the plugin
  next attempts to write to the log. If logging is enabled when this command
  is used, the plugin tries to write to the file immediately with a
  timestamped message recording the time of logging activation.

:AnnotateEventLog {message}                                *:AnnotateEventLog*
  Write {message} to the log file on its own line.

:DeleteEventLog                                              *:DeleteEventLog*
  Delete log file if it exists.
